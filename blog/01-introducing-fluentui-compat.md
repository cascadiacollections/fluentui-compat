# Introducing fluentui-compat: Performance-First FluentUI React Utilities

## Why We Built fluentui-compat

As React applications grow in complexity, render performance becomes critical. FluentUI React provides excellent components, but when you're managing hundreds of icons, async operations, and complex state management, every millisecond counts. That's why we created **fluentui-compat** - a collection of performance-optimized utilities and components designed to complement FluentUI React.

## What is fluentui-compat?

fluentui-compat is a Rush monorepo containing high-performance utilities and components for FluentUI React applications. It focuses on two key areas:

1. **Render Performance Optimization**: Components and hooks designed to minimize unnecessary re-renders
2. **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Support for React 16.14+ through React 19.x

The project consists of two main packages:

### @cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat

The core library provides performance-optimized utilities:

- **bundleIcon**: A memoized higher-order component for compound icons that intelligently switch between filled and regular variants
- **useAsync**: A React hook for managing async operations with automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **useConst**: A hook for creating truly constant values that never change
- **useForceUpdate**: A utility hook for forcing component re-renders when needed
- **useSetTimeout/useBoolean**: Additional utility hooks for common patterns

### @cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat-webpack-plugin

A Webpack 4/5 plugin that automatically rewrites imports from @fluentui packages to use fluentui-compat equivalents, making migration seamless.

## Key Benefits

### Performance-First Design

Every component and hook in fluentui-compat is designed with render performance as the top priority. For example:

- **bundleIcon** uses React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when switching between icon variants
- **useAsync** provides stable references to prevent cascade re-renders in child components
- All hooks follow React best practices for minimizing render cycles

### React Version Compatibility

Unlike many React libraries that target a specific major version, fluentui-compat supports:

- React 16.14.0 and above
- React 17.x
- React 18.x
- **React 19.x** (the latest version!)

This broad compatibility makes it perfect for:
- Teams upgrading between React versions
- Libraries that need to support multiple React versions
- Applications with mixed React version dependencies

### Production-Ready Architecture

Built with Microsoft's Rush Stack tools, fluentui-compat follows enterprise-grade practices:

- **Rush.js** for monorepo orchestration
- **API Extractor** for documentation generation and API surface management
- **TypeScript 5.9+** with strict mode for type safety
- **Jest 30.x** with comprehensive test coverage
- **ESLint 9.x** for code quality

## Modern Developer Experience

The project includes:

- **DevContainer support** for instant development environment setup
- **GitHub Copilot integration** for AI-assisted development
- **Automatic API documentation** published to GitHub Pages
- **Change file enforcement** via Rush for proper version management

## Real-World Use Cases

### Icon Performance Optimization

If you're rendering dozens of icons that toggle between filled and regular states (like in a favorites list), bundleIcon can significantly reduce re-renders:

```typescript
import { bundleIcon } from '@cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat';
import { HeartFilled, HeartRegular } from '@fluentui/react-icons';

const HeartIcon = bundleIcon(HeartFilled, HeartRegular);

function FavoriteButton({ isFavorited, onToggle }) {
  return <HeartIcon filled={isFavorited} onClick={onToggle} />;
}
```

### Async Operation Management

Managing timeouts and intervals in React components is error-prone. useAsync ensures everything is cleaned up automatically:

```typescript
import { useAsync } from '@cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat';

function SearchBox() {
  const async = useAsync();
  
  const handleSearch = (query) => {
    // Automatically cancels previous timeout
    async.setTimeout(() => {
      performSearch(query);
    }, 300);
  };
  
  // All timeouts automatically cleaned up on unmount!
  return <input onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

## Getting Started

Installation is simple:

```bash
npm install @cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat
```

For automatic import rewriting during bundling:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @cascadiacollections/fluentui-compat-webpack-plugin
```
